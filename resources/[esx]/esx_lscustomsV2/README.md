Esx_lscustomsV2


This is a lscustoms script i came across on a random forum i looked through it and optimised it and added support for esx. and stated adding support for bennys customs cars.


You should obviously be running esx if you try using this version.


Known issues:

Some mods are missing mostly bennys customs modifications(should be fixed soon).
